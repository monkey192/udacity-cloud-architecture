# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
1) UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce
AttackInstance is performing SSH brute force attacks against "ApplicationInstance". Brute force attacks are used to gain unauthorized access to your instance by guessing the SSH password

2) Recon:EC2/PortProbeUnprotectedPort
EC2 instance (ApplicationInstance) has an unprotected port which is being probed by a known malicious host. 
Detail: 
ApplicationInstance opens port 5000, without setting any restricted on it.
So Scanners on the internet are actively probing it.

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

AWS GuardDuty analyzes and processes Foundational data sources, such as AWS CloudTrail management events, AWS CloudTrail event logs, VPC flow logs (from Amazon EC2 instances), and DNS logs.
in this system, VPC flow is enable. AWS GuardDuty analyzes VPC flow logs and detect the above findings
