Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
- for Web Service Instance:
    - Clients will request access to "Web Service Instance" through "Application Load Balancer",
    So, if there is no special reason, "Web Service Instance" should be sit on private subnet instead of public subnet.
    we can avoid attacking from the internet.

# Poor practice 2
- accessing to "Free Recipes" bucket
instead of going through the internet when we accessing S3 bucket, we should use "VPC Endpoint" to make a connection line with S3 in this case.
Some benifits when we refactor to using "S3 VPC Endpoint"
+ Improved Security: the traffics between our VPC and S3 do not go over the internet. So it elimenates the exposure of data to the public internet
+ Enhanced Performance
+ Cost Optimazation: Since traffic between our VPC and S3 doesn't traverse the public internet, we can save cost for data transfer
...

# Poor practice 3
- "InstanceRolePolicy-C3" is not "Least Privilege Access"
the InstanceRolePolicy-C3 role allows "All S3 Acction" to "All S3 bucket", that sounds bad.
we should follow "least privileged" best practice and consider what role our application need.
