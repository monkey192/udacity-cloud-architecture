## Design for Availability, Reliability, Resiliency
### Concepts
- Availability <br />
  A measure of time that a system is operationg as expected. Typically measured as a percentage <br />
  Availability = `Available for use time / Total of time`
- Reliability <br />
  A measure of how likely something is to be operating as expected at any given point in time.
   <br />
  In other words, how often something fails
- Resiliency <br />
  A measure of a system's recoverability. How quickly and easily a system can be brought back online
